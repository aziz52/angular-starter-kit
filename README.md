# AngularStarterKit

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.0.
This is a starter project for Angualr. I have added some basic module and code structure that supports eager and lazy loading. I have added esLint to the project for code formatting.
I have also used pre-commit git hook to lint the code before getting commited using husky.


## Benefits
1. Reduce your initial project setup time by 80%
2. Created based on proven standards and learnings while working on different projects
3. Ready to integrate with any backend API via data service implementation
4. Prebuilt support for Husky hooks for commits and push scenarios which prevents bad git commits and push

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
